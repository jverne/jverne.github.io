## Victor Echo Three Whisky November Alfa

[As I mentioned](http://clevermonkey.org/amateur-radio/2022/03/13/current-events/) in a previous update, I recently decided to restart getting my (Canadian) [amateur radio operator certificate](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf01862.html#B). Well, I can now report that after a few months of study I passed the exam with with a final mark above 80% (99 out of 100!) that gives me access to the entire amateur radio spectrum here in Canada.

11-year old me is ecstatic. That was definitely on 11-year old me's bucket list. Committing to an online course was definitely the way to go for me. I'm an excellent self-starter, but a terrible self-finisher.

The title of this posting is a bit of a lie, though. I don't know how to read or send Morse (or CW) yet. But I am taking a CW course in the fall!

I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this new privilege, but maybe I'll take my H/T outside for a walk this evening and at least introduce myself on the local repeater.
