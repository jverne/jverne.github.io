## Taking this blog in a new direction

So, the thing about a tech blog is that you ought to publish regularly. The other thing about tech blogging is that it has a flavour. Like, is this a "fabulous adventures in coding" for some of the big software giants out there? Is it a hobbyblog? A daddy blog? Should I publish Instant Pot recipes?

I work for a big global company, and I'd be happy to relay "notes from the underground" but that was the theme of my old dead blog that I lost the backups for, so all you got is the WayBack data. So, kind of done with that. And while I do have a lot of hobbies and distractions, joints like hackaday.io work really well to scratch that itch.

It comes down to time well spent. How much time after The Job and the Parenting do I have to ressurect retro computers I've inherited, or dedicate to playing bass, or hacking on my VCV Rack?

Speaking of that dead blog of mine, I used to weigh in, in that Web 2.0 manner, on the politically charged internet moments _de jour_. Back then it was all Open Source This and What Does Freedom Really Mean That, but at the end of the day I'm reacting. But, it felt like noise to me, and it still does. The pieces I am most interested from those days are those that critique the so-called "rationalist" movement, and their pop pysch books (again, of the moment).

It's noise because we _still_ have pop pysch cultish leaders giving lectures on YouTube on about "Guns and Germs", or coming up with silly all-beef diets, and then hitting the news aggregators to  cash in on their Patreons.

The thing is that I'm not longer compelled to do much of any of that. Time is short, and I reallu ought to put more time into my bespoke blogging and artisnal DIY modular synths. I need to spend more time writing poetry and tending to my beard than haggling over our bleak future. The Moment can be daily grist for the blogging mill, but it isn't _essential_ enough to make a difference.  

I mean, there's a difference between having an opinion on "race" and "gender" when that opinion is prompted by _L'Outrage de semaine_, and taking the time to, as the kids said when I was a kid:

> Read a fucking book.

I mean, your local library has titles by all sort of people. Not just cult leaders and shitty presidents-for-life. Heck, the long form internet isn't exactly drying up as traditional newsie joints put up their paywalls. We can _read_ about these things literally _everywhere_, and have a nuance, informed opinion, instead of the endless recycle of Bad News from Afar. If there was ever a civilization that needed needed someone to take a long, hard look at it, it is this civilization that we are building together. And, like any large public work, civilization is never finished. Expect cost overruns and a very, very long tail.

And these are _hard_ problems we have to solve. I mean, if you are getting that upset at razor commercials enough to bitch about it online, then you are not keeping your eye on the prize here. We have created a civilization around the notion that companies can sell you targeted ads that are intended to make a statistically signficant number of men, aged $MY_EXACGT_AGE cry. If you don't like that, then let's change how the world works. If you are just angry because this company has changed how they market to your _specific_ demographic asfter all these decades, then I don't know what to say.

Maybe: there are bigger fish to fry here. Either help out, or get the fuck out of the way.


Truth be told, in my lazy way I'm asserting my own versions of "Lead, or get out the way!" or "Your either part of the solution, or you are part of the problem."

So, let's not do a political blog, or a photo blog, or a project blog.
