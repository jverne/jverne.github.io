One of the [Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/) projects I backed finally delivered, which means I am the proud owner of [a Wigl dancing robot]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_urlÂ 2016-04-24-w-i-g-l %}). We've been looking forward to giving this to A., and each birthday or gifty holiday that passes we were wondering if it would arrive on time.

Well, it finally arrived a little after Christmas (or, it arrived right on time for Orthodox Christmas, if we are keeping score) so we went ahead and surprised her with it.

There was a little bit of organizing to do in the computer shack necessary to get things to a state where we could make solder smoke, not to mention a fair amount of moving "treasures" around to her new workbench. But once we got that out of the way, things related to the electronics assembly progressed relatively smoothly.

I guess we ought to start with the unboxing, of a sort:

Here's all the parts, inexpertly knolled:

And here's the completed board:

Here's a close-up. My soldering skills are a bit weak, and I _really_ need thinner solder. So I'm not going to show the reverse side.

I made a few mistakes but managed to resolve them without damaging anything. And when we hook up a 9V battery to the board and turn it on, the RGB LED seems to react with a variety of colours depending on the presence and pitch of sounds captured on the microphone. So that's a win.

A. helped a little, but I wasn't sure we were ready to dive right into soldering yet; at least with the gear I have. I tried to enage her with selecting parts and holding some tricky bits while I made the smoke.

The project has not published the full assembly directions yet, so we stopped here. It looks pretty straightforward, but I think I want to wait until I see the hints around putting the wheels on and figuring out motor direction and whatnot. It's also unclear how to reprogram the AVR chip without a proper header, but I haven't really looked closely at that yet. It does appear to have some working program already on it, so that'll do for now.

So, a qualified win. I was a little too timid about enagaging A. with the actual assembly and soldering. I'll do better when we assemble the hardware. The fiddly puzzle-like pieces and actualy nuts and bolts are something she is looking forward to messing around with.
