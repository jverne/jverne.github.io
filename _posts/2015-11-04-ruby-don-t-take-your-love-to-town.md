As I alluded to in [an earlier posting]({% post_url 2015-10-27-ruby-tuesday %}) I've switched from Pragmatically learning Python (again!) to refreshing my Ruby and Rails skills. There was a method to this madness; as of today I am officially a Ruby and Rails developer, working for a growing startup here in Sleepy University Town.

This is all kinds of good news! First, it's good to be gainfully employed, of course. But, probably more importantly, this finally looks like an excellent fit for my rather unique set of skills. This might be the first time that a set of interviews actually required me to answer questions that make sense for someone with over 15 years of experience as an enterprise developer. And this company, like many startups, likes to get particularly close to their customers, something I am really good at doing.

So, I'm going to have to get good at reading and hacking Ruby, really fast. And I'm going to have to immerse myself in a pretty well established, multi-repo Rails suite over the next few months. I will be expected to ramp up, and quick. 

So, also slightly terrifying news!

So, yeah. Python is going to have take a back seat, again. Ruby is my new life. My life, Ruby.

Right now I'm working my way through this [Ruby On Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/) I found last week. It presumes little knowledge of Ruby, or object-oriented coding in general, which is usually not something I want. But appraaching Rails from first principles so I'm less lost looking at my demp apps, and showing me how to build up a tested, testable, MVC Rails web app from nothing is the sort of learning I respond deeply to. Re-learning Ruby this way, along with the [Pick-axe Book](https://pragprog.com/book/ruby/programming-ruby), is a great way to reinformce The Ruby Way.

I'm very much looking forward to diving into some beautiful Ruby with a team dedicated to quality, and especially looking forward to working at a shop where quality and co√∂peration are centre-stage.

Here's to exciting and terrifying!
