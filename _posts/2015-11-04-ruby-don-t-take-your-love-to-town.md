As I've alluded to in [an earlier posting]({% post_url 2015-10-27-ruby-tuesday %}) I've switched from [Pragmatically](https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/tips) learning Python (again!) to refreshing my Ruby and Rails skills (again!). There was a method to this madness; I have accepted a position as a [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) developer, working for a growing startup here in Sleepy University Town.

This is all kinds of good news! First, it's good to be gainfully employed, of course. But, probably more importantly, this finally looks like an excellent fit for my rather unique set of skills. This might be the first time that a set of interviews actually required me to answer questions that make sense for someone with over 15 years of experience as an enterprise developer. And this company, like many startups, likes to get particularly close to their customers, something I am _really_ good at doing.

I'm also going to have to get good at reading and hacking Ruby, really fast. I'll be immersing myself into a pretty well established, multi-repo Rails suite over the next few months. Not to mention the usual new-hire stuff like peer names, local development processes, code reviews, and so on. I will be expected to ramp up, and quick, as this is a senior developer position.

So, also slightly terrifying news!

So, yeah. Python is going to have take a back seat, again. (Upon closer inspection, it was nailed to its perch.) Ruby is my new life. My life, Ruby.

Right now I'm working my way through this [Ruby On Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/) I found last week. It presumes little knowledge of Ruby, or object-oriented coding in general, which is usually not something I want as a very experience multi-language hacker. But appraaching Rails from first principles so I'm less lost looking at my demo apps, and showing me how to build up a tested, testable, MVC Rails web app from nothing (instead of _always_ invoking `rails new ...` is the sort of learning I respond deeply to. Re-learning Ruby this way, along with working through the [Pick-axe book](https://pragprog.com/book/ruby/programming-ruby), is a great way to reinforce [The Ruby Way](http://therubyway.io/) (a book I should really consider buying, now that I have a book budget).

I'm very much looking forward to diving into some beautiful Ruby with a team dedicated to quality, and especially looking forward to working at a shop where quality and co√∂peration are centre-stage.

Here's to exciting and terrifying!
