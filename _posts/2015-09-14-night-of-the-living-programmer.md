I'm not sure how I feel about today being [Day of the Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Programmer). Perhaps because these days it feels more like Day of the Brogrammer or Night of the Living Programmer (perhaps depending on if your shop is Agile or not).

Maybe I'll celebrate by showing up to one the [Geek Week](https://geekweekwr.ca/) events this week. Tonight is something called [HackerNest](http://waterloo.hackernest.com/events/hackernest-kitchener-waterloo-september-tech-social-3/) which refers to itself as a "tech social". (I note that HackerNest which is a very silly name, indeed, though I suppose silly names are very much part of programming culture.)

I'm not sold, yet, on any need to further discuss "tech" in this town, but perhaps I'll be pleasantly surprised.

Perhaps.
