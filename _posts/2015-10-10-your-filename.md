It occurs to me that this 2007 MacBook Pro I'm using is on its second motherboard, its third battery, its third hard drive, its second charger, and its second set of memory sticks.

Now I want to keep it alive long enough to replace all the fans and reseat the heatsinks. I'll be tempted to replace the capacitors as they start to dry out and fail, too.
