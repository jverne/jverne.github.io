I authored an entry on [my new camera](http://ricoh-imaging.ca/en/products/cameras/Q-S1/), but Prose.io ated it. Anyway, I recently got a sweet deal on a Pentax Q-S1, so I went for it. I'll probably talk about this more in the future, once I've had a chance to play with it more.

It feels like years ago, but I pre-orderd a [Tessel 2](https://www.tessel.io/) when it was announced. I had a very specific idea of what I wanted to do with it, but now I can't remember what that was. For now, I'll add it to the [list of embedded devices]({% post_url 2015-09-09-embedded-device-zoo %}). I'm sure I'll talk more about that in the future.

I'm also pretty sure I'm about to get an oscilloscope so I can finish trying to fix the [TRS-80 Model 100 basketcase]({% post_url 2015-09-08-how-to-not-repair-a-dinosaur %}) I have. No sense in letting the beautiful pleather slip-case go to waste. I even have a perfectly capable cassette player ready to `CLOAD` some BASIC goodness into it once it's running again.

All this and more, I promise. Thought, right now I'm immersed in some for-pay C++ hacking. Because, for some reason, I keep getting hired as a Java or Lua coder and end up hacking on C++. All I've learned to date is that header files are weird, structs are weirder, and `new` is evil.

clvrmnky, out.
