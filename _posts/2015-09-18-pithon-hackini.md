My daughter wrote a sign declaring when it is suitable to do some Python Hacking:

We decided this ought to be a cocktail of some sort.

The "Dirty Hacktini":

- 2 oz. gin
- 0.5 oz. dry vermouth
- dash Fee Bros. Orange Bitters
- dash olive brine

Combine ingredients in a shaker with ice. Pour into a cocktail glass and garnish with an olive, a "Perl" onion, and a gherkin.
