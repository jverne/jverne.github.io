My daughter wrote a sign declaring when it is suitable to do some Python Hacking:

We decided this ought to be a cocktail of some sort. We decided it needed to be a classic martini, with a twist. Well, not a "twist" because that isn't classic. Anyway, we give you...

The "Dirty Hacktini":

- 2 oz. gin
- 0.5 oz. dry vermouth
- dash Fee Bros. Orange Bitters
- dash olive brine

Combine ingredients in a shaker with ice. Pour into a cocktail glass and garnish with an olive, a pickled "Perl" onion, and a gherkin.
