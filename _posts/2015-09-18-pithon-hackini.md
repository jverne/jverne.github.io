My daughter made a sign declaring when it is suitable for us to do some Python Hacking:

Living with a 5-year old is often an exercise in time-management, leading us to experiment with various go/no-go signs related to when we need to do some work, or when TV is off limits, and so on. It appears she has internalized this mode of communication.

We decided this ought to be a cocktail of some sort. We decided it needed to be a classic martini, with a twist. Well, not a "twist" because that isn't classic. Anyway, we give you...

The "Dirty Hacktini":

- 2 oz. gin
- 0.5 oz. dry vermouth
- dash Fee Bros. Orange Bitters
- dash olive brine

Combine ingredients in a shaker with ice. Pour into a cocktail glass and garnish with an olive, a pickled "Perl" onion, and a gherkin.
