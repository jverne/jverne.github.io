Since I'm a Ruby and Rails developer now (and I'm told that these two things are distinct and separate!) I've also been reviewing and practicing Ruby development with Rails-centric IDEs. Ideally I want to know which one I like enough to use at my new job.

Since I'm a big [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) fan, my first choice was using it as a lightweight IDE. And it is certainly adequate for this purpose. I had to keep switching back from full-screen to a zsh terminal, though, to do the stuff that developers like to do at a POSIX shell, and this was annoying. I tried some of the plugins that offer basic shell access with little success. And, I have to admit, one of my favourite things about Eclipse is how I can climb inheritence trees when trying to figure out code.

So, right now I'm plowing through a Rails tutorial using OS X split-screen with [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) and Firefox, which gives me a full IDE, the tutorial and Ruby API reading material I need, and several tabbed zsh and console windows. It's really nice being able to build and deploy a Rails app live, and then tweak it as you go. Like most JetBrains products, it is very polished and complete. I'm pretty much loving it.

I know some of my new co-workers use [Cloud9](https://c9.io/), which is a cloud-hosted RoR environment. So I might give that a try next week. Initially I was a skeptic of so-called cloud solutions, but being able to jump into my Rails projects from anywhere sounds pretty cool. I suppose it makes a certain amount of sense to have a cloud-based IDE if your app is almost immediately going to be deployed to a cloud, and your version control is a different cloud. It certainly has a lot of fans, and appears to be ultra-complete. Now, I'm not sure how often I'll want to work on a Rails app from any lappy that isn't my work lappy, it's certainly worth a try. Maybe for chapter 5 of the tutorial I'll use C9.

I should probably give [Komodo](http://komodoide.com/) a whirl, too, but I might not have the time to review it properly. We really are spoiled for choices these days. Also, at some point you just have to choose. I ended up using Eclipse mostly because my co-workers were using it. If they had been using NetBeans I probably would be a fan of that. This process might be about finding out what other people use. Which reminds me that I _could_ switch to NetBeans as a Ruby IDE, too. There is a small irony in there somewhere.

Part of me wishes I could just hack together a _classique_ environment using GVim and plugins, but this is actually a bit dangerous. I'm the sort of person that could get lost in the details of setting this up, instead of investing time in one IDE so I can get good enough to start fixing bugs in an unfamiliar codebase.

I've been around this block a few times, you see.
