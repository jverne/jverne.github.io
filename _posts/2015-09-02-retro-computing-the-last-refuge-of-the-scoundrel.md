Because I can't seem to get enough of 1980s high-technology, I've decided to attempt to resurrect a [TRS-80 Model-100](http://www.oldcomputers.net/trs100.html) I inherited years ago. Unfortunately, I made a classic rookie mistake by not properly putting it back together the last time I looked at it, so now I may have misplaced all the hardware that keeps it together.

Assuming I can find the specific plastic 35mm film canister I recall stuffing the screws and other fasteners, hopefully I'll be able to surf the web at 300 baud and code in TRS-80 Basic soon.

Luckily, [there are other folks out there with similar interests](http://www.club100.org/) such that I was able to get my paws on two different service manuals for the Model 100. Even more lucky for me, it was written with the complete novice in mind, with troubleshooting flowcharts and what-not to aid the technician in finding out why the thing won't go.

In this case, "won't go" means "appears to power up, but only displays a bar across a single column of the display". I've already verified some basic voltages and so on, and my fear is that we are on to the part of the manual where I need to start 'scoping out waveforms. With the oscilloscope I don't have.

I don't need any excuse to buy a 'scope, and I don't need an excuse to [shave more yak](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html) turning my Arduino or [my lappy into a 'scope](http://www.instructables.com/id/Use-Your-Laptop-as-Oscilloscope/). But I might *have* to.

The end goal here is simple: earn the [Hack a Day Retro success](http://retro.hackaday.com/Success/index.html) achievement badge**[esc]5Xi**t-shirt.
