So, I'm home sick from work today and, as one does, I'm idly playing around with some emulation stuff. Earlier I was researching my KIM-1 emulation project (which is turning out to be a bit harder than I thought).

Then, for some reason, I decided to get [IBM PC-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_DOS) 7.x/2000 working on [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). This is not for any particular reason, though I've occasionally needed a real DOS environment to mess about with [abandonware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware). So, this image may be put to good use one day.

But for now, an almost-complete PC-DOS system. I haven't figured out the networking stuff yet, but it has CD-ROM support, DOSIdle so it doesn't burn up my Mac, the usual assortments of high/upper/confusing/WTF memory, and so on. I don't think networking will be that hard, but my Google-Fu is not finding the PCNet ethernet drivers that VirtualBox is emulating. So, for now I'm using sneaker-net.

Yeah. So, that's a [Rexx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexx) script being called via the command interpreter via a pseudo [hash-bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29) mechanism (think of `/* ... */` as the shebang line). There's a reason I liked to run _PC_-DOS instead of that other one.

What's going to bend your noodle is that I actually _paid_ for a copy of PC-DOS, lo, those many years ago. So, I'm _technically_ not pirating anything, matey.
