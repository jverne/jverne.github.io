My great hope of resurrecting some of my _better_ posts from the old self-hosted clevermonkey.org may be fully dashed.

I cannot, for the life of me, find the backup of the MySQL database that powered that site, lo, those many yers ago. I have a terrible feeling that I reused the drive to save @Carmen's old Mac image when she got the new Air, and I inherited the old Macbook Pro.

I have one even older drive to check, which requires the usual hoop-jumping. But I'm thinking those bits are lost to the ages. My own personal Library of Alexandria, and I'm Ceasar.

This mirrors a lot of how I seem to treat the information I've generated over the decades. In the past, I have deliberately purged notebooks full of writings in an effort to shed baggage and move on. But the old blog was different; it was always intended to be public. Personal, but very much intended for everyone to read.

This is an unfortunately loss, if it is a loss. Perhaps I can salvage some of that from the Internet WayBack Machine? Honestly, I suspect only about 1% of the dataset I'm thinking of needs to be saved. It's not like the world is missing another Socrates' Rhetorics here.
