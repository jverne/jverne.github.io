Coding horror lives in a bubble.

Mostly spam, and spam control becomes its own amount of work.

It's my content, make your own.

Prolieration of larger social media sites has meant huge drop in comments anyway.

Part of this is that I lost my old content.

It's not my job.

If this is not a blog, that's ok.
