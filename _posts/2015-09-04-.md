![Screencap of a WUMPUS win](https://flic.kr/p/ycMDBH "WUMPUS II on a TRS-80 Model I")

Apparently, there was a WUMPUS v2.0 for the TRS-80 Model I.

Apparently, I am able to emulate a decent enough TRS-80 Model I on a Mac well enough to run this it from a virtual floppy via LDOS 5.3.1. 

I didn't show a screencap of MMS Forth running on the same emulator. Too geeky.
