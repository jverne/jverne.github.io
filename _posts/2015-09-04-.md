![Screencap of a WUMPUS win](https://flic.kr/p/ycMDBH "WUMPUS II on a TRS-80 Model I")

Apparently, there was a WUMPUS v2.0 for the [TRS-80 Model I](http://www.oldcomputers.net/trs80i.html).

Apparently, I am able to [emulate](http://sdltrs.sourceforge.net) a decent enough TRS-80 Model I on a Mac well enough to run it from a virtual floppy via LDOS 5.3.1.

I didn't show a screencap of [MMS Forth](http://www.millermicro.com/mmsforth.html) running on the same emulator. Too geeky.
