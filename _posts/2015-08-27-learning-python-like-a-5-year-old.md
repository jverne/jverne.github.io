I've been putting off learning Python for a few years now. In some double irony, someone I met on an IRC channel dedicated to Perl is a big fan, and has been prodding me to learn it for nearly as many years.

Recently, though, someone got my 5-year old daughter a classic [Spirograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph) toy for her birthday, and she loves it. It got me to thinking that programming a version of Spirograph might be a neat project, and that led to me to old-school Logo turtle graphics, which led me to an O'Reilly webcast based on the book [Teach Your Kids to Code](https://www.nostarch.com/teachkids). All roads lead to O'Reilly, I suppose.

I then realized that I'd be reinventing the wheel writing such an application, especially when there is a perfectly good [Python turtle graphics library](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/turtle.html) to leverage, and entire books on the subject.

So, we (my daughter and I) are working our way through the aforementioned _Teach Your Kids to Code_ book, making little changes to colours and rules and so on. It's fun!

This has had two results so far, that I have noticed:

- I am actually learning Python, both how to code like a Python coder and also how to make Python go on OS X and Linux. (In fact, the former was a real challenge, as OS X already has Python 2 installed, and installing Python 3 such that Tcl/Tk and idle3 was layed down properly was a bit of a chore.)
- My daughter now asks, out of the blue and in public, "daddy, can we do some Python hacking?", which is a geeky parenting **win**.

Up to now, the concept of coding has been a bit opaque to her, given that the intersection of code and fun she has been exposed to has been the rather tweaky [NQC](https://github.com/jverne/nqc) programs I've written for our LEGO robot projects. (Or watching me hack C++ for my cash money.) Which is to say, not very much exposure at all.

So, once I write this, we are back to ch. 2 of the book, exploring more of the ways we can make Python draw nice pictures. Maybe I'll capture some of the winners and post them here.
