Stop reading this right now and go throw money at the [Circuit Classics crowd-funding effort](https://www.crowdsupply.com/star-simpson/circuit-classics). Throw _all_ your money at them.

Still reading? Ok. Let's try again:

Someone had the awesome idea of creating a set of electronic kits that perfectly capture the design and aesthetic of "Getting Started in Electronics" by [Forrest M.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Mims) [Mims III](http://www.forrestmims.org/), down to the beautiful hand-written notes that accompanied each circuit design.

They are a joy to behold.
