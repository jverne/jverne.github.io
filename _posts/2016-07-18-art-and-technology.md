It seems to me that we might be in the middle of a little art/tech Renaissance right now. Perhaps it is selection bias at work, but I keep running across references to folks putting together cool tech-based art projects that explore art in really interesting ways.

I may be slightly sensitive to this as a Canadian of a Certain Age, of course. A friend once told me about a class he took at university that suggested that Canadian visual arts heavily reinterpreted visual popular media, and even reincorporated image data in other works in a specifically Canadian manner. I'm hand-waving here because this was from a long time ago, and was probably the sort of discussion we would have over many beers. But I recall it really brought into sharp relief some of the things I'd been thinking about, say, Cronenburg films and Canadian body-horror cinema.

(Yes, there is a _specifically_ Canadian body-horror Å“uvre. Long live the New Flesh.)

I was also exposed to coding and hacking at a pretty early age, and at a time when such things were a little obscure and magical. I'd always had a natural affinity for pants-seat engineering, so it was natural that I'd be one of those people to whom computing, electronics, and robotics where a bit like catnip.

I mention this only to set the stage for an attempt at an explanation for why I think some of the artistic "maker" expressions I'm seeing are really interesting and worth noticing. As a kid who tried to _actually_ write _vers libre_ poetry in [Forth](https://www.forth.com/forth/), projects like the [1-Bit Symphony](http://1bitsymphony.com/) really resonate deeply with me. I mean, one of the artefacts is a poster-sized print of the AVR assembly code.

Likewise, I've already gushed about [Circuit Classics](https://www.crowdsupply.com/star-simpson/circuit-classics) which captures a certian aesthetic that meshes well with a certain artistic sensibility; it isn't _just_ retro-nostalgia at work.

And, recently, I ran across another art/music/tech collision in the form of an algorithmic exploration of techno entitled [Spicule](http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/spicule) which I immediately identified as of a piece, spiritually, with these other projects I've mentioned.

These are just the highlights. I'm also reminded of local Maker Space "noise nights" and countless sequencer projects that litter the internet. I admit that many of these projects are half-baked (at best), and much of the hardware shipped ends up getting dusty on well-meaning shelves, but the fact remains that _something_ seems to be going on that tickles the hell out of that 14-year old that had so much trouble articulating the notion that computers were (or could be) these cool toys of artistic expression.
