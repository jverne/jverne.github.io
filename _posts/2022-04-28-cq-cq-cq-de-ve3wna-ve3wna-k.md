### CQ CQ CQ DE VE3WNA VE3WNA K

[As I mentioned](http://clevermonkey.org/amateur-radio/2022/03/13/current-events/) in a previous update, I recently decided to re-restart getting my [Canadian amateur radio operator certificate](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf01862.html#B) by joining an [online course hosted by a club out East](https://avarc.ca/index.php/online-basic-course/). Well, I can now report that after a few weeks of study I passed the exam with a final mark above 80% (99 out of 100!) which gives me access to the entire amateur radio spectrum here in Canada.

11-year old me is ecstatic. That was definitely on 11-year old me's bucket list. Committing to an online course was definitely the way to go for me. I'm an excellent self-starter, but a terrible self-finisher.

The subtitle of this posting is a bit of a lie, though. I don't know how to read or send Morse (or CW) yet. But I am taking a virtual CW course in the fall [hosted by my local club](https://www.ve3yt.com/cw-course), so it's only a little lie. I suspect CW is going to be a bit more of a challenge, as in many ways it is like learning a new language. And, yes. I am already looking ahead to studying for the Advanced qualifications.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this new privilege to use the airwaves, but maybe I'll take my H/T outside for a walk this evening and at least introduce myself on the local repeater. I do have some ideas about turning my bicycle trailer into a mobile station for lower carbon-load field days, but we'll see.
