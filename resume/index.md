c++, make, openbsd, osx, lego

NQC (Not Quite C) is a programming language for several LEGO MINDSTORMS products including the RCX, CyberMaster, and Scout.
  
I created this repository from the latest source available from the last maintainer and updated it to work with modern compilers on OpenBSD and OS X. Much of my work has involved updating serial I/O, cleaning up the UI, and adding comprehensive internal logging facilities.

At this time I am the de facto maintainer for the NQC project.

lua, lightroom

A Lightroom Publish Service for 23 Photo Sharing
  
I created this Publish Service to allow me to publish and update photos directly from Lightroom to 23 Photo Sharing. I had to work closely with 23 Photo Sharing to work through bugs in the API implementation as well as workaround various UI limitations in Lightroom.

**GitHub - Arduino**, [https://github.com/jverne/Arduino](https://github.com/jverne/Arduino), *June 2015*

html, java, arduino, python

open-source electronics prototyping platform
  
I have contributed a few patches over the years, before the source was hosted on Github. I continue to make regular pull requests.

## Background
Technology related interests include exploring “little languages” and experimenting with language parsers and compilers. My interest in bare-metal coding, retro computing, and electronics keeps me busy as an electronics, embedded systems, and programmable LEGO hobbyist. I try to make the time to submit changes to open-source projects I am interested in, and maintain an Adobe Lightroom plug-in. I am a proponent of the pragmatic advice to learn at least one new computer programming language each year.

Other interests include a lifelong love of film and digital photography (especially where that intersects with my interest in image processing and coding) and cookery. I try to stay active by committing to commuting by bicycle for much of the year. I enjoy both playing and listening to music. I play both guitar and the electric bass. I am an amateur oenophile, mixologist, and whisky enthusiast.
