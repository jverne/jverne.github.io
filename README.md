A Github Pages personal site. I started basing this off the minimal
theme, but then abandoned that and went in my own ultra-simple direction.

This is mostly an experiement so I can set up a site for someone else, 
instead of hosting a full CMS.

The idea is to create a site where all pages and posts are 100% markdown,
with all templating down through Jekyll and Liquid, so all editing and
updating can be done through something like Prose.io.

The CSS is going to be the trickiest to get right.
