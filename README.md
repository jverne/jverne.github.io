A Github Pages personal site for [The Clever Monkey](http://www.clevermonkey.org). I started basing this off the minimal
theme, but then abandoned that and went in my own ultra-simple direction.

This is partly an experiment to figure out all the edges when setting up a site for someone else instead of hosting a full CMS. The idea is to roll-up a solution using Github Pages, Jekyll, and [Prose.io](http://prose.io) to get a non-technical blog and home site.

Since I am not particularly proficient with CSS, I've opted for a W3.CSS powered site. I may experiement with multiple responsive column layouts, but for now this remains an ugly single-column tech site where I blog about stuff that interests me.
